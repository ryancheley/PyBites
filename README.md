# What is this?

This is my repo for the work I'm doing on the PyBites platform https://codechalleng.es

# Why put it on GitHub?

A couple of reasons:

* I want to keep the work I've done just in case something happens to my MacBook Pro
* I want to get in the habit of commiting work to GitHub on a (mostly) daily basis
* To make it easier to reference to on my blog at https://ryancheley.com
